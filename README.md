📌 Overview

The HR Data Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive analytics solution built in Power BI to transform raw HR attendance data into meaningful insights. Using the attendance dataset, this dashboard enables HR professionals and business leaders to monitor workforce presence, analyze attendance patterns, and make informed decisions.

The dashboard highlights key metrics such as:

Total Working Days vs. Present Days – overall workforce presence.

Attendance Trends – daily presence % tracked over time.

Work From Home (WFH) % – distribution of remote working days.

Sick Leave (SL) % – absence trends across employees.

Day-of-Week Analysis – patterns in attendance, WFH, and sick leave by weekdays.

Employee-Level Breakdown – individual performance with present %, WFH %, and SL %.

By leveraging interactive visuals, filters, and slicers, the dashboard allows users to drill down into specific employees, departments, or time periods, making it easier to identify attendance issues, optimize workforce planning, and improve productivity.

This project showcases how Power BI can be used in HR analytics to replace manual reporting with an automated, interactive, and visually engaging solution. It serves as a strong example of how organizations can turn HR data into a strategic asset for decision-making.
